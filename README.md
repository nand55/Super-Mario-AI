# Super-Mario-AI
An A.I automated python languaged written  model to learn and  a game using reinforced learning technique - Super Mario Bros
Using techniques like gray scaling , vectorization and framstacking and basic machine learning algoritms , this game is coded with 
To set up the game , following important reuirements :
- gym-super-mario library and Nes-py ( A virtual emulator / Joypad that controlls the movement of a character via keys). Both of these python libraries are based on OpenAI framework call 'openai gym'.
- Applying a PPO Algorithm and creating a model based on it.
  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm utilized in the field of artificial intelligence. In the context of AI, PPO refers 
  to an optimization method that aims to improve the policies of AI agents in a manner that ensures stability and efficiency during training.
